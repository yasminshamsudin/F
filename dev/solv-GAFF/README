# Scripts for 3rd gen solvatochromism electric field calculations
The starting structure here comes from Geometry optimized structures (HF 6-31d*) and ESP charges.

The 1st script converts the charges to RESP charges using antechamber and converts the structure and GAFF2-parameters to gromacs format.
The 2nd script builds and solvates the system. The solvent parameters (GAFF2, RESP) are created using the 1st script and optimized structures.
The 3rd script automatically finds the probe atoms and charges and creates the input files for MD simulations and electric field calculations.
The 4th script should be placed on a cluster. It creates the run file and submits it to the cluster.
