# F
A program for calculating electric fields.
Solvent parameters for GAFF and OPLS included.

- 1st gen automates the protocol for calculating electric fields in solvents.
- 2nd gen creates boxes of specified size and fills them with solvents. 
- 3rd gen expands the parameter set and simulation options.
