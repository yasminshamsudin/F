# F
A program for calculating electric fields.
Solvent parameters for GAFF and OPLS included.

- 1st gen automates the protocol for calculating electric fields in solvents.
- 2nd gen creates boxes of specified size and fills them with solvents. 
- 3rd gen expands the parameter set and simulation options.

## How to use the scripts?
Starting from an optimized ligand structure in GAUSSIAN, these scripts should be run in the order they are numbered. Download the whole folder and create a folder inside it named PREP. Put your resp-file in the PREP folder.
To run a script type
> bash XXXXXX.sh

where XXXXX is the script you want to run.
Wait for the script to finish running. Then run the next one.
If you are not running all these scripts on the cluster you are using you should upload the files after script 3.XXX.
Script 4.XXX should be run on a cluster.
